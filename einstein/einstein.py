# Solve E = mc**2 wherein E represent energy and M is entered by the user c is represented by the speed of light and is set to 300000000

# As for M as an integer
m = int(input("Enter m: "))
# sets c to the speed of light approx.
c = 300000000
# computes the formula
E = (m * (c ** 2))

# prints the answer
print(E)
